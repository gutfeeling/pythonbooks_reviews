# Review Python books listed on [pythonbooks.org](http://pythonbooks.org)

Pythonbooks.org is a website that classifies and ranks Python books. In addition, visitors can leave reviews if they have 
a GitHub account.

## Here's how you can leave reviews

1. Every book has a corresponding issue page on this repo. [See an example issue page](https://github.com/gutfeeling/pythonbooks_reviews/issues/80).
2. When you comment on the issue page, your comment shows up as a trusted review on [pythonbooks.org](http://pythonbooks.org). [See how 
this looks like](http://pythonbooks.org/two-scoops-of-django-best-practices-for-django-18/#review-row).

## Guidelines

The following are simple guidelines on how to organize your review. They are not strict rules, so you are free to organize your 
reviews differently. 

1. Start the review by stating how many stars out of 5 you will give this book. For one star, simply type `:star:`. GitHub 
will render it as :star:. For two stars, type `:star: :star:`. This will be rendered as :star: :star:. And so on. The best 
books should get 5 stars and the worst books should get 1 star.

2. In the same line as the star, add a very short summary of your opinion about the book. Think something in the lines of "Great book for Python beginners" or "Didn't learn much from this book, won't recommend". The summary line should be bold, formatted using `**`.

3. Include the following information in your review:
    
   - *When did you read this book?*
   
   - *What was your state of knowledge when you started reading this book and what were you expecting to learn?*

   - *Did the book meet your expectations and help you learn the subject matter? If yes, how much did it improve your 
     knowledge?*

   - *What did you like most about the book? What did you dislike the most?*
   
   - *What makes the book unique or memorable (if applicable)?*
   
   - *Who can benefit from this book? Would you recommend it to others?*
   
4. Any headings in the review text should be h3 formatted using `###`. 

3. If you have read similar Python books, share how this book compares to the others. If you provide a comparison, please link to the other book's [pythonbooks.org](http://pythonbooks.org) page.

## Formatting 

Github style markdown is supported. 

## It might take upto 10 minutes for your reviews to show up on the site

Since the webpages are cached in the backend and the cache is flushed every 10 minutes, there might be a delay of upto 
10 minutes before your review shows up on the site.

## I don't have a GitHub account. How do I leave a review?

You can also send your review to reviews@pythonbooks.org. Don't forget to mention the name and author of the book you are 
reviewing. It might take a few days for your review to show up on the site.
